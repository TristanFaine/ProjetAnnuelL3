Stop assuming that at some point in life you reach art-Nirvana and suddenly artmaking gets easy. That\u2019s a lie. I've talked to Master artists and they're just like us. \n\n\n2\\. Stop assuming other artist\u2019s work reflects on yours. It doesn\u2019t. Artists today aren\u2019t like union plumbers or carpenters who have a singular mission and use collectively agreed upon methods. \n\n\n3\\. Stop being your own archenemy. You\u2019re going to feel like everyone is lining up to reject your work. I often describe the art business like walking through an endless gauntlet with people on each side who are screaming \u201cyou suck\u201d, pointing and laughing at you, punching you in the gut and then kicking you in the balls (or ovaries.) \n\n\nFun times right? You f\u2019n right. Bring it on. This profession isn\u2019t for the feint of heart. You have to be an infantryman, a working class blue-collar grunt who doesn\u2019t give two f\u2019cks about our work being hard. We go where angels fear to tread. I\u2019m a veteran, loaded meat in a meat packing plant and was a former first responder \u2013 artmaking is harder than those.\n\n\nAny Neanderthal can do hard labor but it takes a real moxie to be vulnerable, dig deep to engage your core philosophy, and then display that to the masses. \n\n\n*\u201cLet me tell you something you already know. The world ain't all sunshine and rainbows. It's a very mean and nasty place, and I don't care how tough you are, it will beat you to your knees and keep you there permanently if you let it. You, me, or nobody is gonna hit as hard as life. But it ain't about how hard you hit. It's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward; how much you can take and keep moving forward.
